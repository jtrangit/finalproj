Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have created a discord bot in our discord test server.
The bot can also repeat what a user has typed in the chat.
The bot can also delete messages sent in the discord chat.
Using praw, a reddit api we were able to create a command that lets the bot log into reddit
and have it go to a subreddit and pick between a random number of posts sorting by whatever we set it to.
For example, right now the command is set for the bot to choose a post from r/memes sorting by new.
We also added a bot command called $make me hungry which does the same thing just only with the subreddit r/food.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Things we have not done

-Filter nsfw (18+) content
-Do not post pinned moderator posts
-Have the bot embed videos in the posts as a playable link rather than just post the link
-Have the bot run forever without needing replit open
-command only specifies subreddit and does not specify how to sort posts

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Problems 

-Figuring out how to use the api
-Getting the bot to send the link correctly
-When sorting by new the bot would only link the most recent post
-Sometimes bot would only post a pinned post of the subreddit
-the bot only runs when the code is running 
-bot only posts the link in video posts
-need to filter nsfw posts
